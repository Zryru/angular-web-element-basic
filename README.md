# WebElement

A very simple test of creating a web element from app component (whole application?)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build --output-hasing=none` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

then `node build-script.js` to create one file of the web element to use on any other web frontend. The build element will be stored in `elements\angular-app.js` unless the script is modified.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
